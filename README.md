Systematic and algorithmic trading strategies.


This repository contains:
- Systematic trading strategies.
- Signal generation, statistical analysis of signal significance and correlation.
- Derivatives pricing models.


Asset classes:
- Equity: for availability and liquidity.
- Commodities: for diversification and I am interested in power, gas and oil markets.
- Cryptocurrency: for ease of access to intraday trading data.


How To:
1. Run the notebooks.
   - Much of the analysis is driven from notebooks to better render visuals.
   - Assume this repo is cloned into the folder: `/Users/joe/code/trading/`.
   - Activate the conda env.
   - Run: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Users/joe/code/`. Only need to do this once.
   - cd `/Users/joe/code/trading/`.
   - Launch `jupyter lab` from here --> allows imports from the whole project: `from trading... import ...`







Bookkeeping:
- Models developed here represent my own interest; opinions expressed are my own, and not those of my employer.
- Strategies are under continuous development.
- Collaboration, discussions and content suggestions are welcome :)


See readMe in each subsection for further guidance.
